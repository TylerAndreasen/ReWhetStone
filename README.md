# README

[Planning Board](https://github.com/users/TylerAndreasen/projects/2/views/1)



Things you may want to cover:

* This Web App should not be deployed, as it is an educational tool.

* Ruby 3.2.5

* Rails 7.1.5

* System dependencies: Docker Desktop,

* How to run the test suite: NYI

* Database creation: Run `rails db:migrate` from a command line attached to the docker container. This should create all necessary database files. 

* Database initialization: [NYI] If ever implemented, test data will be created with the Ruby gem, Faker. Eventually, the command would be `rails db:seed`.

TODO::

* Configuration

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
