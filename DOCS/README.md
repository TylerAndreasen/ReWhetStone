# **Documentation README**

As I have learned, it is very important to have notes on how systems are built, how subsytems are designed,
& how and why elements function the way they do. The other docs within this directory will use `Rails` to specify the `Ruby on Rails Framework` and `Ruby` to refer to the standard `Ruby language`. This is mildly important as various files (many automatically generated) will either be standard `Ruby` files (extention `.rb`), or `Embedded Ruby files`, with the extension `.erb`.  

It is my intention as of the time of writing this to take notes on a number of things:

- [ ] A Ruby On Rails Overview
- [ ] The Model-View-Controller Framework in general (low-priority)
- [ ] The Models and Controllers of WhetStone
- [ ] The Views and Routes of WhetStone (this I feel was an undertalked about component when implementing the Portfolio App as a class.)
